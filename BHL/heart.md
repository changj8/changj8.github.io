# Heart

## Pericardium [Triage]

- These can be grossed fresh OR
- Fix in formalin overnight

## Pericardium [Gross Description]

- Dictate specimen received
- Measure specimen in three dimensions
- Describe specimen appearance
  - Color
  - Consistency (thick, delicate, etc.)
  - Indicate abnormalities – fibrosis, calcifications, osseous metaplasia, thrombus, etc.

## Pericardium [Section Submission]

- Section the specimen and submit representatives
  - Thin strips to be submitted on edge
- Usually 1-2 cassettes is sufficient

## Partial Resection [Triage]

- Weight
- Measurement in three dimensions
- Fix in formalin overnight

## Partial Resection [Gross Description]

- Dictate specimen received
- Dictate weight and measurement 
- Identify any attached structures
  - Pericardium
  - Valves (measure in three dimensions and describe as above)
  - Coronary arteries
  - Papillary muscle
- Describe any abnormalities or masses
  - Size
  - Color, Appearance
  - Distance to margins (if mass) – make sure margins are inked

## Partial Resection [Section Submission]

- Submit representative sections of any masses or lesions (at least 1 section per centimeter)
- If the specimen is grossly normal, submit 1-2 blocks of representatives 

## Heart Tumor [Triage]

- Weight
- Measurement in three dimensions
- Fix in formalin overnight
- TDAAC if applicable
- Take pictures

## Heart Tumor [Gross Description]

- Dictate specimen received
- Dictate number of pieces received
- Dictate measurement
- Indicate presence and appearance of epicardium, endocardium, and any muscle attached
- Describe the appearance
  - Color, texture
  - Masses – size, color, texture, distance to margin
        - If the mass is intracavitary, note whether it is pedunculated or sessile
- Ink the resection margins
  - Sample the margins in relation to the mass
- Describe the remaining specimen

## Heart Tumor [Section Submission]

- Generally 1 section per 1 centimeter of mass is sufficient
- Try to avoid submitting too many necrotic areas
- Use decal if necessary
- Submit mass with resection margin
- Submit any other abnormalities

## Heart Transplant [Triage]

- Weight
- Measurement in three dimensions (A-B, A-P, Transverse)
- Fix in Formalin overnight
  - Sometimes it is helpful to put paper towels within the heart to help the inside fix as well

## Heart Transplant [Gross Description]

- Dictate specimen received
- Dictate weight and measurements
- Coronary arteries
  - Serially section the coronary arteries
        - Right Main Coronary
        - Left Main Coronary
        - Left Anterior Descending
        - Circumflex
        - Posterior Descending Artery
- Dictate any abnormalities 
  - For calcifications and occlusions, dictate percentage of artery occluded
        - <25% stenosis
        - 25-50% stenosis
        - 50-75% stenosis
        - 75-99% stenosis
        - 100% (occluded)
  - Be specific to artery if abnormalities are found
- Outer surface
  - Describe color and texture
  - Dictate presence of pericardial fat, hemorrhage, etc.
- Serially section the heart from apex to base
  - Stop sectioning just before the atrioventricular valves
- Open the remainder of the heart via blood flow (as is done in autopsy)
- Measure the circumference of the valves (4 total)
  - Note any abnormalities (measure, describe, indicate which valve)
- Measure thickness of right ventricle, left ventricle, and interventricular septum
  - Describe the appearance of the ventricle walls
  - Indicate abnormalities (measure, location, appearance)
  - Myocardial infarcts
          - Number
          - Location (anterior/posterior, medial/lateral, walls vs. septum, which wall)
          - Extent (subendocardial versus transmural)
          - Size
          - Color and consistency
- Describe chordae tendinae (thickened, fused, etc.)
- Describe endocardial surface 
  - Indicate any abnormalities (size, appearance)
- Describe the atria
  - Inner surface appearance
  - Wall thickness
  - Abnormalities (if present)

## Heart Transplant [Section Submission]

- Left atrium
- Right atrium
- Left ventricle
- Right ventricle
- Interventricular septum x 2
  - One transverse section
  - One sagittal section
- Infarcts and abnormalities
- Vein grafts (if present)
- Significant coronary artery lesions or occlusions (use decal if necessary)

## Arterial Plaques [Triage]

- These can often be done fresh
- If not, they can fix in formalin overnight

## Arterial Plaques [Gross Description]

- Dictate specimen received
- Dictate the number of pieces
- Dictate size in three dimensions
  - 1-2 pieces, give each size
  - Multiple pieces, give range of sizes
- Describe the color and appearance
- Indicate presence of thrombus, calcifications, or occlusions

## Arterial Plaques [Section Submission]

- Decal the specimen if there are calcifications
- Submit the entire specimen if it is small
- Submit representatives if the specimen is large

## Cardiac Valves
