# Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
## Intraoperative Consultations
- Sentinel nodes are occasionally sent for mastectomy or segmental cases
- Occasionally the nodes contain a biopsy clip
  - If you get this for frozen section, carefully section the specimen and look for the biopsy clip
  - Make notes about what kind of clip was found and where it was located
- For ductal (IDC, DCIS)
  - Depending on the attending on frozens, touch preps can be performed first
  - If the touch prep is inconclusive, you may have to freeze part of or all of the lymph node
- For lobular (ILC, LCIS)
  - These lymph nodes need to be frozen every time
- Procedure
  - Measure the lymph node
  - Make notes about any abnormalities on the outer surface
  - Section the nodes at 0.2 cm intervals
  - Make touch preps if DCIS or IDC
  - Select sections to be frozen (For ductal or lobular)
    - If you see something grossly positive, you can freeze that
    - If you donâ€™t see anything abnormal, you may have to freeze the entire lymph node

## Triage
- Measure in three dimensions
- Fix in formalin overnight
- Record the time the specimen is placed in formalin for future time to and duration of fixation calculations

## Gross Description
- Dictate the specimen received
- Dictate the measurements
- Dictate the number of nodes identified 
  - Give a range of measurements
- Describe the outer surface of the lymph nodes
- Serially section the lymph nodes at 0.2 cm intervals
- Describe the cut surface
  - Indicate any areas that are grossly positive
    - Describe appearance
    - Describe whether they appear confined to the lymph node
  - Color, texture
- Submit the lymph nodes
- Dictate the time to fixation and duration of fixation using the Duration of Fixation Calculator on the P drive
    - Use the time you placed the specimen in formalin during triage

## Section Submission
- Grossly positive
  - Representative sections of grossly positive lymph nodes
- Grossly negative
  - Submit entirely
