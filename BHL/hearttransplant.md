## Heart Transplant [Triage]

- Weight
- Measurement in three dimensions (A-B, A-P, Transverse)
- Fix in Formalin overnight
  - Sometimes it is helpful to put paper towels within the heart to help the inside fix as well

## Heart Transplant [Gross Description]

- Dictate specimen received
- Dictate weight and measurements
- Coronary arteries
  - Serially section the coronary arteries
    - Right Main Coronary
    - Left Main Coronary
    - Left Anterior Descending
    - Circumflex
    - Posterior Descending Artery
- Dictate any abnormalities 
  - For calcifications and occlusions, dictate percentage of artery occluded
    - <25% stenosis
    - 25-50% stenosis
    - 50-75% stenosis
    - 75-99% stenosis
    - 100% (occluded)
  - Be specific to artery if abnormalities are found
- Outer surface
  - Describe color and texture
  - Dictate presence of pericardial fat, hemorrhage, etc.
- Serially section the heart from apex to base
  - Stop sectioning just before the atrioventricular valves
- Open the remainder of the heart via blood flow (as is done in autopsy)
- Measure the circumference of the valves (4 total)
  - Note any abnormalities (measure, describe, indicate which valve)
- Measure thickness of right ventricle, left ventricle, and interventricular septum
  - Describe the appearance of the ventricle walls
  - Indicate abnormalities (measure, location, appearance)
  - Myocardial infarcts
    - Number
    - Location (anterior/posterior, medial/lateral, walls vs. septum, which wall)
    - Extent (subendocardial versus transmural)
    - Size
    - Color and consistency
- Describe chordae tendinae (thickened, fused, etc.)
- Describe endocardial surface 
  - Indicate any abnormalities (size, appearance)
- Describe the atria
  - Inner surface appearance
  - Wall thickness
  - Abnormalities (if present)

## Heart Transplant [Section Submission]

- Left atrium
- Right atrium
- Left ventricle
- Right ventricle
- Interventricular septum x 2
  - One transverse section
  - One sagittal section
- Infarcts and abnormalities
- Vein grafts (if present)
- Significant coronary artery lesions or occlusions (use decal if necessary)
