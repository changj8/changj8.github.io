# General Notes on Breast Specimens
## Tips and Advice
- Planning and Imaging
  - Breast cases are always easier to handle and assess if you prepare beforehand
  - Radiology and previous pathology reports are incredibly important when assessing and grossing breast specimens
    - They confirm the number of masses or nodules deemed suspicious
    - They indicate the number and location of biopsy clips
    - They indicate the general location and presence of calcifications
    - They indicate if the patient underwent pre-surgical treatment
    - ***It is important to correlate any previous imaging or reports with your current specimen***
  - Read prior breast biopsy report
    - Different grossing protocols are followed for:
      - Invasive carcinoma (ductal, lobular, etc.)
      - Ductal carcinoma in situ
  - Read previous reports (mammogram, US, MRI) so you can gather the following information:
    - Number of lesions
      - General sizes, location, quadrant, clock face
    - Presence of biopsy clips or sites
      - Location, clock face, quadrant, shape/type
    - Presence of calcifications
      - Location, clock face, quadrant, general size
    - You can draw a map or a list of the identified areas of suspicion, which will make it easier to develop a grossing plan
  - For patients with a history of neoadjuvant therapy, it is important to know the pre-treatment estimate of size and location of the original tumor

- Inking
  - Ink tends to run very easily on breast specimens 
  - Segmental Mastectomy Specimens
    - Make sure to be conscious of your gloves when inking because your gloves can carry ink onto incorrect surfaces
    - Spray the specimen with vinegar when you are done inking
    - Give the ink some time to set before sectioning
  - Mastectomy Specimens
    - Make sure to use vinegar to set the ink before you section the specimen
    - Give the ink some time to set before sectioning
    - Place paper towels between each slice to stop any ink from running once you start sectioning
    - Spray each tissue slice with vinegar as you section the specimen 

## Duration of Fixation
- According to CAP guidelines on ER, PR, and Her2 testing, it is required to document the “Time to Fixation” and “Duration of Fixation” on breast specimens in the pathology report.
  - Breast specimens must fix for at least 6 hours and no more than 72 hours in formalin in order for this testing to be valid
  - Sample Dictation: “The time to fixation for specimen #__ is __ hours and __ minutes. The duration of fixation for specimen #__ is __ hours and __ minutes.”

## Duration of Fixation on Friday
- If you receive a breast specimen on Friday, it is suggested that that specimen be grossed in on the following day (Saturday) to ensure that the specimen does not exceed the 72 hour requirement
- If you are not grossing a breast specimen on Saturday, then a piece of the tumor or lesion needs to be submitted on Friday so that duration of fixation does not exceed 72 hours
  - You can occasionally collect a needle core from the specimen if the mass is palpable
    - Use a needle core gun to collect 1-3 samples of the mass to submit on Friday
    - Make sure to watch your hands as the needle core gun is sharp
    - Do not pinch any wires or yourself with the needle core gun once it is engaged
  - If you cannot palpate the mass or lesion, you may need to cut the specimen open
    - For mastectomies, this isn’t usually an issue because you have to cut them anyway on triage
    - For segmental mastectomies or biopsies, this may require some extra steps that do not occur in normal triage
      - Make sure to ink the specimen appropriately before cutting into it so as to maintain proper margin orientation
      - Bread loaf the specimen looking for the lesion – this allows the specimen to mostly stay intact after you sample the lesion
  - Submit the piece of lesion in a cassette (usually cassette A) on Friday
  - Make sure to dictate or write down the specific duration of fixation for that piece since it will differ from the rest of the specimen (the rest of the specimen will exceed 72 hours so this is important)
  - Submit the piece of lesion with a pink sheet

## Late Friday Breast Core Handling Procedure
- Friday early afternoon
  - Breast cores should theoretically be performed in the early afternoon to allow the specimen to fix for at least 6 hours before being placed on the processor
  - If a breast biopsy is going to arrive late
    - Stony Point Breast Clinic will call the frozens line to warn that a breast biopsy is going to arrive late
      - Make sure to get the name and MRN of the patient and the number of breast cores in the sample
    - When the specimen arrives, time stamp the requisition sheet and accession the case
      - Make sure to accession the specimen as “BRST CORES LT” or “BRST CORES RT” so that the appropriate levels are ordered
  - Gross the case
    - Dictate the specimen received
    - Dictate the number of cores received
    - Measure the length and diameter of the cores
      - If there are more than two, you can provide a range
    - Describe the appearance
  - Submit the cores
    - Submit in clam shells or a biopsy bag
    - Submit in a light pink cassette
    - Load onto the appropriate processor (usually routine or fatty)
  - Calculate the duration of fixation
    - Usually, the cores go on the routine processor
    - If the cores are extremely fatty or if there are a lot of cores, they need to go on the fatty processor
- Friday late afternoon/evening
  - The breast cores should be grossed on Saturday and loaded into the processor
  - Gross the cores as described above
  - If you are placing the cores on the processor on Saturday, you have to add 24 hours to the duration since the processor doesn’t start until Sunday
  - If there is no fatty processor set on Saturday, call the histotech on call and have them set one for you if the cores require it

## Processing Breast Specimens for Evaluation of Residual Cancer Burden
- Processing the Primary Tumor Bed
  - Use imaging and previous pathology results to identify the tumor bed
     - Research the original tumor size and location
    - For multi-centric cases, the sampling and measurements should be of the largest residual tumor bed
  - When the tumor bed is identified, include the specific orientation in the measurements (superior-inferior, medial-lateral, anterior-posterior)
- Sectioning
  - Try to section the specimen to allow for the largest cross sectional area of the tumor bed to be assessed
  - Block and submit the largest cross sectional area of the tumor bed
    - This can be done in a composite section
    - Be descriptive in your summary of sections to help identify where each piece is located in the composite
    - A picture can be used as a block diagram if that is more helpful or easier
  - If the tumor bed is small (less than or equal to 2 cm) submit the whole tumor bed
  - If the tumor bed is larger than 2 cm, submit one section per one centimeter of greatest dimension
  - Make sure to sample areas with different gross appearance 
  - Submit the usual additional sections – nearest margins, quadrant samples, nipple, lymph nodes
- Processing lymph nodes
  - Sentinel lymph nodes or an axillary dissection are often received with the main specimen
  - Identify all received lymph nodes
  - Section the lymph nodes at 0.2 cm intervals
  - If a node is grossly positive
    - Submit a complete cross section (or the entire node) of positive lymph nodes
  - Small or grossly negative nodes should be submitted entirely
