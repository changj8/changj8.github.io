# Breast Core Biopsies
## Triage
- These cases often are received in formalin
- Make sure that the case will have been in formalin for at least 6 hours before being processed
- Make sure that the specimen will not exceed a duration of fixation of 72 hours

## Gross the case
- Dictate the specimen received
- Dictate the number of cores received
- Measure the length and diameter of the cores
  - If there are more than two, you can provide a range
- Describe the appearance
- Dictate the time to fixation and duration of fixation
  - The time to fixation for biopsies is less than an hour
  - The duration of fixation is calculated in the Duration of Fixation calculator depending on which processor you are going to use

## Section Submission
- The specimen should be entirely submitted
- Submit in clam shells or a biopsy bag
- Submit in a light pink cassette
- Load onto the appropriate processor (usually routine or fatty)
  - If you are not sure, ask a PA or chief resident
