# Breast Reductions
## Triage
- Weigh
- Measure specimen
  - If multiple pieces, provide a range in three dimensions
  - If one piece, measure in three dimensions
  - Include measurement for the aggregate of skin shaves, if present
- Fix in formalin overnight
  - These can also be done fresh as long as the duration in formalin will be at least 6 hours before the processor starts
- Record the time the specimen is placed in formalin for future time to and duration of fixation calculations

## Gross Description
- Dictate the specimen received
- Dictate the weight
- Dictate the measurement
- Describe the skin surface
  - Color, texture, any lesions
- Describe the underlying breast parenchyma
  - Indicate any lesions with distance to margins
  - Dictate the fatty to fibrous ratio

## Section Submission
- 2-4 blocks of uninvolved breast parenchyma
  - If the reduction is taken from a patient who had carcinoma on the contralateral breast, you may want to submit additional sections due to increased risk of carcinoma
- Include skin on some sections
- You can put multiple pieces of tissue in a single cassette
- If lesions are identified
  - Submit the lesions with nearest margins
  - Submit 1 section per cm of lesion

## Sample Dictation – Breast Reduction
Specimen #1 is received fresh in a single container labeled with the “patient name” and “designation”. Received is a __g, __ x __ x __ cm aggregate of multiple fragments of tan-brown lobulated fibroadipose tissue with attached pieces of (pink/brown) (smooth/wrinkled) skin ranging from __ x __ x __ cm to __ x __ x __cm. Serially sectioning reveals unremarkable tan-brown parenchyma, with approximately __% fibrous tissue. No masses or lesions are identified. Representative sections are submitted in multiple cassettes. Time to fixation is __ hours, __ minutes and, duration of fixation is __ hours, __  minutes.
