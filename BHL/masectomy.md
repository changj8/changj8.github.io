# Masectomy
## Prophylactic [Triage]

- Weigh
- Measure in three dimensions (superior-inferior, medial-lateral, anterior-posterior)
- Measure the diameter of the nipple
- Measure the diameter of the areola
- Measure the skin on the anterior surface (if present) – medial to lateral, superior to inferior
- Ink
	- Anterior superior = blue
	- Anterior inferior = green
	- Posterior = black
	- Spray with vinegar when completely inked
- Serially section from medial to lateral (unless another circumstances requires you section in a different plane)
	- Place towels between each section
	- Spray each section with vinegar
- Fix in formalin overnight
- Record the time the specimen was placed in formalin

## Prophylactic [Gross Description]

- Dictate the specimen received 
	- Indicate the correct type of specimen
		- The operative note usually indicates the type of specimen
	- Types of mastectomies:
		- Simple
		- Total
		- Modified Radical
		- Skin-Sparing
- Dictate the weight
- Dictate the orientation provided
- Dictate the measurements per the orientation
- Describe the skin on the anterior surface
	- Size
	- Appearance
	- Any lesions – if present, measure to peripheral resection margin
- Describe the nipple and areola
	- Color, any abnormalities or lesions
- Dictate the inking scheme
- Dictate the direction in which the specimen was sectioned
- Describe the cut surface 
	- Lesions/masses
		- There should be no lesions – if there are, refer to the “Breast Cancer” section
	- Tumor bed
		- There should be no residual tumor bed – if there is, refer to the “Breast Cancer s/p Chemotherapy” section
	- No lesions
		- Appearance – fatty to fibrous ratio, any other abnormalities (cysts, calcifications, etc.)
- Section the lateral aspect to look for any lymph nodes
- Dictate the time to fixation and duration of fixation using the Duration of Fixation Calculator on the P drive
	- Use the time you placed the specimen in formalin during triage

## Prophylactic [Section Submission]

- Perpendicular section of nipple/areola
- Any skin lesions
- There are usually no masses/tumor bed – if there are, refer to the “Breast Cancer” section
- 1-2 blocks of uninvolved breast parenchyma from each quadrant
	- Determine how many sections submitted based on appearance of specimen
	- Indicate which quadrant each block belongs to 

## Breast Cancer [Triage]

- Weigh
- Measure in three dimensions (superior-inferior, medial-lateral, anterior-posterior)
- Measure the axillary tail in three dimensions
- Measure the diameter of the nipple
- Measure the diameter of the areola
- Measure the skin on the anterior surface (if present) – medial to lateral, superior to inferior
- Ink
	- Anterior superior = blue
	- Anterior inferior = green
	- Posterior = black
	- If there is skeletal muscle on the posterior surface, you may want to ink it a separate color (i.e. orange)
	- Spray with vinegar when completely inked
- Serially section from medial to lateral (unless another circumstances requires you section in a different plane)
	- Place towels between each section
	- Spray each section with vinegar
- If there is an obvious mass, submit some for TDACC if it is big enough
- Fix in formalin overnight
- Record the time the specimen was placed in formalin

## Breast Cancer [Gross Description]

- Review imaging and previous reports to develop a game plan for any clips, masses, or lesions present
- Dictate the specimen received 
- Indicate the correct type of specimen
	- The operative note usually indicates the type of specimen
- Types of mastectomies:
	- Simple
	- Total
	- Modified Radical
	- Skin-Sparing
- Dictate the weight
- Dictate the orientation provided
- Dictate the measurements per the orientation and the measurement of the axillary tail
- Describe the skin on the anterior surface
	- Size
	- Appearance
	- Any lesions – if present, measure to peripheral resection margin
- Describe the nipple and areola
	- Color, any abnormalities or lesions
- Describe the outer surface
	- If there is skeletal muscle posteriorly, indicate that
- Dictate the inking scheme
- Dictate the direction in which the specimen was sectioned
- Describe the cut surface 
	- Lesions/masses
		- Size in three dimensions
		- Appearance – color, texture, definition
		- Location
			- Clock face
			- Quadrant
		- Distance to margins
			- Posterior (also indicate if skeletal muscle is involved, if present)
			- Anterior
			- Nipple
		- Biopsy sites
			- Clip – type, location
			- Biopsy cavity – size, location, relationship to mass/lesion
	- Tumor bed may be present
		- Size in three dimensions
		- Appearance
		- Location
			- Clock face
			- Quadrant
		- Distance to margins
			- Posterior
			- Anterior
			- Nipple
	- Remaining cut surface
		- Appearance – fatty to fibrous ratio, any other abnormalities (cysts, calcifications, etc.)
- Section the lateral aspect to look for any lymph nodes
- Section the axillary tail to search for lymph nodes
	- Lymph node goal: 10 lymph nodes
- Dictate the time to fixation and duration of fixation using the Duration of Fixation Calculator on the P drive
	- Use the time you placed the specimen in formalin during triage

## Breast Cancer [Section Submission]
- Skin
	- Perpendicular section of nipple/areola
	- Any skin lesions
- Mass
	- Generally, 1 section per centimeter of mass
	- Nearest posterior margin
	- Skeletal muscle, if involved
	- Nearest anterior margin
	- Nearest nipple (if close enough)
	- Any grossly different areas
	- Biopsy clip site (indicate this specifically in the summary of sections)
	- Flanking normal
	- Dense fibrous areas or potential tumor bed
		- Representatives if you think they are lesional or related to imaging
- For DCIS with no obvious mass
	- Submit abnormal dense fibrous tissue from all of the quadrants
		- Submit at least 3-4 blocks
	- Submit dense fibrous tissue from the lesional area indicated by the radiology reports in the patient’s clinical history
		- Depending on the size, submit multiple cassettes
	- If you locate the biopsy site, submit multiple representatives from around the biopsy site including the biopsy site
- 1-2 blocks of uninvolved breast parenchyma from each quadrant
	- Determine how many sections submitted based on appearance of specimen
	- Indicate which quadrant each block belongs to 
- Axillary tail
	- All lymph nodes
