# Segmental and Excisional Biopsies
## General Notes
- Oriented excisional breast biopsies and segmental mastectomies are treated the same way
- Make sure that the orientation makes sense before continuing to ink or section the specimen
  - If the orientation doesn’t make sense, ask a PA or chief resident
  - If the orientation still doesn’t make sense, contact the surgeon

## Triage
- **NOTE – Area of Interest on Segmental Mastectomies**
  - Segmental mastectomies are received in radiology containers with a plastic grid over them
  - In iSite/Stentor, the “Area of Interest” is indicated on the imaging in the presentation state submitted by the radiologist
  - This “Area of Interest” needs to be inked red 
    - Using a Q-tip, ink the holes in the grid that correspond to the indicated area on radiology
    - Once the ink is set, remove the plastic grid and fill in the remaining spaces between the dots so that the area is a square/rectangle
  - Record the bracket locations for the “Area of Interest” because it will be dictated later
    - Also record the color of ink and the location of the area of interest (superior, inferior, medial, lateral, etc.)
- Weigh
- Measure in three dimensions
- TDAAC if possible or requested
- Take pictures if the specimen has a strange shape or is received inappropriately (in pieces, disrupted, etc.)
- Fix in formalin overnight
- Record the time in formalin so you can calculate the duration and time to fixation later

## Gross Description
- Dictate the specimen received
- Dictate the weight and the type of specimen received
  - Unoriented breast biopsy
  - Oriented breast biopsy
  - Oriented segmental mastectomy
- Dictate how the specimen is oriented
- Dictate the measurements per the given orientation
  - Example: __ cm (S-I) x __ cm (M-L) x __ cm (S-D)
  - S-D = Superficial to deep
- Indicate if the specimen is received with metal localization wires
  - If they are present, indicate how many wires are present
  - For each wire, indicate where the wire enters the specimen and whether or not it exits the specimen
  - If the wire exits the specimen, indicate where
  - Example: “The specimen is received with a single metal localization wire, which inserts medially and courses laterally to exit on the lateral surface.”
- Indicate if the specimen is received with a radiograph and a designated area of interest
  - Dictate the bracket location of the area of interest
  - Indicate what color the area of interest is inked and which surface it is located on
- Describe the outer surface
- Provide the inking scheme
  - Unoriented breast biopsies are inked entirely one color
  - Oriented segmental mastectomies and breast biopsies are inked 4 colors
    - The two larger, flatter surfaces are inked blue and black
    - The two skinnier, narrow edge surfaces are inked green and orange
    - Your tips will have all four colors meeting at the tip
      - Your tips are indicated by the direction you are sectioning in
      - For example: If you are sectioning the specimen from medial to lateral, you will have a medial tip and a lateral tip where all four colors will meet
  - Make sure that the entire outer surface is inked and that there are no uninked areas
  - If the specimen has skin on it, you will ink the specimen perpendicular to the skin, so keep that in mind when creating your inking scheme
  - Ask a PA or senior resident if you have questions on your inking scheme – do not ink before you ask!
- Dictate in which direction the specimen is sectioned in
  - Medial to lateral, superior to inferior, superficial to deep, anterior to posterior
- **Take a picture once the specimen is serially sectioned**
  - **You will use this as a block diagram**
- Describe the cut surface
  - Lesion/Mass
    - Size in three dimensions
    - Color, shape, definition
    - Distance to margins
      - Measure to all inked margins and your two tips (you should have 6 total measurements)
- Describe any evidence of clips or biopsy sites
  - Describe clip, if found – type, color
    - You should know if a clip is present based on previous radiology (where you found your area of interest) or on previous reports in the patient’s chart
  - Describe relationship of clip to other identified lesions/masses
  - If identified, give margin status (unless the biopsy site is in the center of the identified mass)
  - If a clip is identified, put it in a tissue bag and save it in the container
  - If you cannot find a clip
    - Make a good effort to find the clip without disrupting the specimen too much
    - Ask a PA or senior resident for help
    - If you have identified a mass, but can’t find the clip, submit the mass and dictate that no clip was identified
    - If you cannot find a mass or the clip, take the specimen to mammography and have them image your tissue slices
      - Make sure to call beforehand to make sure they have time to see you
  - Describe the remaining cut surface
- Dictate whether the specimen is entirely submitted or if representative sections are submitted
- Dictate the time to fixation and duration of fixation
  - Use the Duration of Fixation Calculator on the P drive

## Section Submission
- NOTE: Start by trying to submit your necessary sections in 12 cassettes
  - If you need more cassettes or need to submit the specimen entirely, discuss your plan with a PA or the attending on the breast service
- Mass
  - Generally, 1 section per 1 cm of mass
  - Include all margins
  - Include biopsy clip sites (do not submit the biopsy clip)
    - Make sure to note in your summary of sections which block has the biopsy clip site in it
  - Include any areas that look grossly different
  - Indicate your sections on your block diagram picture
- No lesion
  - If no lesion is identified, submit all of the abnormal fibrous tissue, especially if the patient has a history of DCIS
- Tips
  - Perpendicularly section and submit all or a representative depending on size

## Sample Dictation – Oriented Segmental Mastectomy
Specimen #1 is received fresh in a single container labeled with the “patient name” and “designation”. Received is a __g, oriented segmental mastectomy specimen received with the following orientation: ___ (read orientation provided on requisition sheet). Per this orientation, the specimen measures:  __ cm superior to inferior, __ cm medial to lateral, and __ cm anterior to posterior. The specimen contains a metallic localization wire, which enters the (superior/inferior/lateral/medial/superficial/deep) surface and courses (superiorly/inferiorly/medially/laterally/superficially/deep) and (does not exit/exits at the ___ margin). The specimen is also received with an indicated area of interest at the following location: {letter-letter] [#-#], which is on the __ surface and is inked ___ (color). The outer surface of the specimen is tan-yellow and lobulated and is inked as follows: superior margin = orange, inferior margin = green, anterior margin = blue, and posterior margin = black. Serially sectioning the specimen from medial to lateral reveals a __ x __ x __ cm (poorly/well) circumscribed, tan-brown, (firm/rubbery/soft/necrotic) mass with focal (calcifications/hemorrhage). The mass is located in the (superior/inferior/medial/lateral/anterior/posterior) aspect of the specimen under the inked area of interest. The mass is __ cm from the superior margin, __ cm from the inferior margin, __ cm from the anterior margin, and __ cm from the posterior margin, __ cm from the medial margin, and __ cm from the lateral margin. A biopsy tract with a __ clip is in the (superior/inferior/medial/lateral/anterior/posterior) aspect of the specimen, located __ cm from the mass. The biopsy clip site is is __ cm from the superior margin, __ cm from the inferior margin, __ cm from the anterior margin, and __ cm from the posterior margin, __ cm from the medial margin, and __ cm from the lateral margin. The remaining tissue is tan-brown and unremarkable, with __% fibrous tissue. Time to fixation is __ hrs __ minutes, duration of fixation is __ hours __ minutes. Representative sections are submitted in multiple cassettes.
