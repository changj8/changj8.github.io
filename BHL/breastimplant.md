## Gross Description
- Dictate the specimen received
- Dictate the weight and measurements
- Describe the outer surface
  - Texture, color
  - Indicate if there is any sticky material on the outer surface – indicates potential disrupted implant
  - Any inscriptions - Read anything that is written on the outer surface
    - Brand name, size, serial number, etc.
