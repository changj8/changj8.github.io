# Breast

## Masectomy

### Prophylactic
#### Triage

- Weigh
- Measure in three dimensions (superior-inferior, medial-lateral, anterior-posterior)
- Measure the diameter of the nipple
- Measure the diameter of the areola
- Measure the skin on the anterior surface (if present) – medial to lateral, superior to inferior
- Ink
	- Anterior superior = blue
	- Anterior inferior = green
	- Posterior = black
	- Spray with vinegar when completely inked
- Serially section from medial to lateral (unless another circumstances requires you section in a different plane)
	- Place towels between each section
	- Spray each section with vinegar
- Fix in formalin overnight
- Record the time the specimen was placed in formalin

#### Gross Description

- Dictate the specimen received 
	- Indicate the correct type of specimen
		- The operative note usually indicates the type of specimen
	- Types of mastectomies:
		- Simple
		- Total
		- Modified Radical
		- Skin-Sparing
- Dictate the weight
- Dictate the orientation provided
- Dictate the measurements per the orientation
- Describe the skin on the anterior surface
	- Size
	- Appearance
	- Any lesions – if present, measure to peripheral resection margin
- Describe the nipple and areola
	- Color, any abnormalities or lesions
- Dictate the inking scheme
- Dictate the direction in which the specimen was sectioned
- Describe the cut surface 
	- Lesions/masses
		- There should be no lesions – if there are, refer to the “Breast Cancer” section
	- Tumor bed
		- There should be no residual tumor bed – if there is, refer to the “Breast Cancer s/p Chemotherapy” section
	- No lesions
		- Appearance – fatty to fibrous ratio, any other abnormalities (cysts, calcifications, etc.)
- Section the lateral aspect to look for any lymph nodes
- Dictate the time to fixation and duration of fixation using the Duration of Fixation Calculator on the P drive
	- Use the time you placed the specimen in formalin during triage

#### Section Submission

- Perpendicular section of nipple/areola
- Any skin lesions
- There are usually no masses/tumor bed – if there are, refer to the “Breast Cancer” section
- 1-2 blocks of uninvolved breast parenchyma from each quadrant
	- Determine how many sections submitted based on appearance of specimen
	- Indicate which quadrant each block belongs to
