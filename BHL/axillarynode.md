# Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
## Triage
 -Measure in three dimensions
- Record the time the specimen is placed in formalin for future time to and duration of fixation calculations

## Gross Description
- Dictate the specimen received
- Dictate the measurements
- Palpate the specimen for as many lymph nodes as you can find
  - The goal is to find at least 10 lymph nodes
- Give a range of sizes of the lymph nodes (measurements in three dimensions)
- Describe the outer surface of the lymph nodes
- Serially section the larger lymph nodes at 0.2 cm intervals
- Describe the cut surface of the lymph nodes
  - Color, texture, distinct lesions, etc.
- Trim the excess fat from the nodes
- Submit all of the lymph nodes
- Dictate the time to fixation and duration of fixation using the Duration of Fixation Calculator on the P drive
  - Use the time you placed the specimen in formalin during triage

## Section Submission
- Positive nodes
  - Submit 1-2 representative sections of the lymph node if it is grossly positive
  - Indicate which nodes are grossly positive in your summary of sections
- Negative nodes
  - Submit all
  - Section the larger nodes and place them in multiple cassettes
    - Indicate this in your summary of sections if you have to do this
